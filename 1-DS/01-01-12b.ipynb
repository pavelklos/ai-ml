    "## 1. What are Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks are interactive web applications that allow you to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. The name \"Jupyter\" comes from the core programming languages it was designed for: **Ju**lia, **Pyt**hon, and **R**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features and Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interactive Computing**: Execute code blocks and immediately see results\n",
    "- **Rich Media Output**: Display charts, images, videos, and interactive widgets\n",
    "- **Literate Programming**: Combine explanatory text with code for self-documenting analysis\n",
    "- **Language Flexibility**: Support for over 40 programming languages (via kernels)\n",
    "- **Reproducible Research**: Share complete analyses with code, results, and explanations\n",
    "- **Educational Tool**: Excellent for teaching and learning programming and data science\n",
    "\n",
    "### History and Evolution\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter evolved from IPython Notebooks (created by Fernando Pérez in 2001) and became a separate project in 2014. Today, it's one of the most popular tools in data science, supporting the full data analysis workflow from exploration to presentation."
